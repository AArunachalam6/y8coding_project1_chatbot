# Y8 Coding Project 1: Chatbot

## Intro

Your task is to create a **chatbot**, showing an understanding of basic Python programming:

- variables
- built-in functions
- data types (string vs. integer)
- selection statements (IF, ELIF, ELSE)
- loops
- string indexing

## Requirements

- Follow along with the teacher demo to create your own chatbot. You are free to incorporate your own ideas, which whilst may be *a little bit silly*, should still be appropriate for school.

- Once you have an understanding of the key programming techniques, your goal is to create a chatbot that matches the requirements shown below as exactly as possible.

Watch the animations carefully to work out what you are being asked to program!
